# C-Sharp-MVC-Frameworks-ASP.NET-Core
The ASP.NET Core course will teach you how to build modern web applications with the Model-View-Controller architecture using HTML5, databases, Entity Framework Core and other technologies. We study The ASP.NET Core Technology Platform, its components and architecture, the creation of MVC web applications, modeling, viewing and partial viewing with Razor view engine, controller definition, database processing, integration with Entity Framework Core, LINQ, and SQL Server. The course also includes more complex topics such as working with users, roles and sessions, AJAX usage, caching, web application security, web sockets, and libraries from MVC controls. Several practical laboratory exercises (labs) and workshops are being built to build comprehensive, full-featured ASP.NET Core web applications. The course includes work on a web application development project and ends with a practical web development exam with ASP.NET Core.
